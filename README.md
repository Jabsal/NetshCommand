# NetshCommand

This is equivalent of running "netsh int ipv4 show dynamicport tcp" in the command prompt 

The code provided uses the System.Diagnostics namespace to execute the "netsh int ipv4 show dynamicport tcp" command and print the output to the console.

The Process class is used to start a new process (in this case, the netsh command) and the ProcessStartInfo class is used to specify the details of the process to be started, the arguments (int ipv4 show dynamicport tcp)
